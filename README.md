# SNA-Project

This project is based on the analysis of a network of several users on Facebook.
This dataset contains two types of information. You will find first a graph obtained by focusing on the neighborhood of 10 nodes in facebook.

In addition, we provide the original data that is more complex. It consists of 'circles' (or 'friends lists') from Facebook. Facebook data was collected from survey participants using this Facebook app. The dataset includes node features (profiles), circles, and ego networks. Facebook data has been anonymized by replacing the Facebook-internal ids for each user with a new value. Also, while feature vectors from this dataset have been provided, the interpretation of those features has been obscured. Facebook data was collected from survey participants using this Facebook app. The dataset includes node features (profiles).

Main tasks of the project:
1. Choose a relevant subgraph
2. Analysis of the subgraph
3. Implementation normalized betweness' centrality function (without NetworkX)
4. Implementation PageRank function (without NetworkX)
5. Community detections
6. Link predictions
7. Implememtation preferential attachment function (without NetworkX)
8. Implementation of bass contagion model's function with personalized features and analysis of the results
